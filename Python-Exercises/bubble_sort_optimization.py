'''
for this task, add two optimizations to the implementation of Bubble Sort.

1) Note that by the end of sweep X, Bubble Sort will have migrated the X largest items 
to their final correct positions at the top X highest slots in the array. So, there 
is no need for each sweep to work over the entire array: later sweeps can stop earlier. 

Figure out how to trip the inner loop with successive passes, but without affecting the accuracy of the sorting.

2) Bubble Sort has a very nice property: if the list is already partially sorted, Bubble Sort doesnâ€™t need 
the entire N sweeps to sort N items. Specifically, it can stop the outer loop earlier under some conditions. 

Figure out what that condition is, and see if you can get it to run much faster on mostly-ordered arrays. 
On an array that is actually completely ordered, Bubble Sort should be able to stop after a single sweep.
